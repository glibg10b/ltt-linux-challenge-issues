- [ ] [Searching "Best Linux distro for gaming" on Google brings up really bad websites.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0506yDSgU7M&t=67s)

### WAN show

- [ ] [The "show desktop" button in KDE doesn't minimize all windows by default.](https://youtu.be/fJB9fdXWiiw?t=497)

## Some other suggestions for developers based on this challenge

- [ ] [Sgt-Miller](https://github.com/Sgt-Miller)
  > If Fastboot is turned on in Windows, the partition is mounted as read-only in Ubuntu. When copying, the error message says "no permission". Please make the error message more descriptive, like for NTFS systems it can say "It was mounted in read-only mode. To write to disk, ensure fast boot is disabled.
- [ ] [Sgt-Miller](https://github.com/Sgt-Miller)
  > Please turn on "Create link" option in Nautilus by default. Or provide creating shortcut by drag+ctrl+shift.
- [ ] [Sgt-Miller](https://github.com/Sgt-Miller)
  > I think gnome-tweaks should be installed by default. User shouldn't have to install an extra tool to change system fonts and to create startup programs.
